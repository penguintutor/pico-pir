# pico-pir
PIR sensor on a Raspberry Pi Pico

This code uses a PIR on a Raspberry Pi Pico to light up LEDs when someone is present in the room. LEDs should be connected from the power supply, with suitable resistor, into pins GPIO6, GPIO7, GPIO16 and GPIO17. 

The PIR sensor should be connected with the data pin to GPIO2.
